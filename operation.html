		<p>Santiago is considering leaving the Nine-Nine in favour of a desk job at Major Crimes. Meanwhile, the Captain and the Sergeant experiment to see just how efficient they can make the precinct when it comes to finishing paperwork.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Adam Sandler interrupts Jake's auctioning and goes onstage, opening up an auction to pay to see him stick a sock in Jake's mouth. Football player Joe Theismann buys this opportunity for $1300 and offers to pay extra if he can do it himself. Jake identifies the suspect and tackles him. He accidentally takes down Joe Theismann and breaks his other leg. Sandler reports that he recorded it.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In the Major Crimes division, Jake apologizes to Amy for calling her a bad partner and tells her that he should have been more supportive. He wrote her a letter of recommendation, but tells her that it's riddled with spelling errors.</p>
