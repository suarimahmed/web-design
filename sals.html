		<p>Jake and Boyle are called to investigate after Jake's favorite pizzeria, Sal's Pizza, gets destroyed in a fire. However, they're not permitted into the site due to Fire Marshall Boone refusing to let them in. Jake is angry at this, knowing that Boone and the officers in charges do not take their role seriously with Boone even suggesting Sal burned its own restaurant.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Jake and Boyle interrogate many of Sal's competitors and fail to find a connection to the crime. They then try to sneak into the scene but are caught by Boone and fire inspectors and detained.</p>
		<br>
		<p>When Holt questions Jake for trying to solve Sal's arson, Jake reveals that it was the place his father took him every time he went playing in the Little League games. This convinces Boone to hand over the investigation to Jake and finally finds the culprit: one of the competitors who stole his recipe to put in his new restaurant.</p>
